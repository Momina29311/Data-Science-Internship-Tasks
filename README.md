## üìÅ Tasks Overview

### ‚úÖ Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset
- **Dataset**: Titanic Dataset / Airbnb Listings Dataset
- **Steps**:
  - Load dataset using `pandas`.
  - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and manage outliers.
  - Visualize data with:
    - Bar charts (categorical)
    - Histograms (numeric)
    - Correlation heatmap (numeric features)
  - Document findings with insights and visual support.
- **Outcome**: A comprehensive EDA notebook/script with visualizations and interpretations.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis
- **Dataset**: IMDB Movie Reviews
- **Steps**:
  - Preprocess text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
  - Convert text to numerical form using TF-IDF or embeddings.
  - Train classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
  - Evaluate with precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Outcome**: A sentiment analysis pipeline with evaluation results and test predictions.

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Fraud Detection System
- **Dataset**: Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- **Steps**:
  - Handle class imbalance using SMOTE or undersampling.
  - Train models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
  - Evaluate with precision, recall, F1-score.
  - Create a CLI interface for transaction testing.
- **Outcome**: A fraud detection system with predictions and evaluation dashboard.

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Predicting House Prices Using the Boston Housing Dataset
- **Dataset**: Boston Housing Dataset
- **Steps**:
  - Normalize and preprocess input data.
  - Implement Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost **from scratch** (no sklearn built-in models).
  - Compare using RMSE and R¬≤.
  - Visualize feature importance for tree models.
- **Outcome**: Custom regression models with performance metrics and feature analysis.
